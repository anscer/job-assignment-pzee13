## How could I help
*Using JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Redux, and MVC Architecture or clean architecture currently I am professional in it, I would build a strong state management system with Redux. This keeps the state predictable and easy to debug. TypeScript will help make the code more reliable and easier to maintain.

*Implement real-time updates using WebSockets to provide immediate feedback to users about the state of the robot.

* Maintain a history of state changes so users can see a timeline of what actions the robot has taken and when.
